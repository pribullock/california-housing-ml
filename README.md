# California Housing Price Prediction

This project applies supervised learning to predict median housing values in California using census data. I trained and compared Linear Regression and Random Forest models, evaluated their performance, and visualized key insights.

## Dataset
- Scikit-learn's `fetch_california_housing()`
- 20,640 rows × 9 columns

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

## Results
- Random Forest R²: 0.81
- MSE: 0.21
- Top Feature: Median Income


## Files
- `California_Housing_Price_Prediction.ipynb`: Final notebook
